# wallpaperd
A simple script and launch agent to always have a nice wallpaper on macOS

## Install

Clone or download everything, then run [install.bash](https://github.com/jtartarin/wallpaperd/blob/master/install.bash) from your terminal. It will copy files in the right place.

You'll have a nice and fresh desktop wallpaper coming from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). It will change on a regular basis so you never get bored.

## Geeks

You can customize the [transform script](https://github.com/jtartarin/wallpaperd/blob/master/transform.bash) (make sure to enable it in the [main script](https://github.com/jtartarin/wallpaperd/blob/master/wallpaperd.bash#L13))

I use it to add some cool stickers, because why not? Have fun with ImageMagick! Who needs a UI, right?
